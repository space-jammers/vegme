* Using `position: absolute` instead of fixed, so scrolling doesn't mess things up
* Added a default duration
* Added a demo page

## 0.3.2

* Use camel-cased style properties (`animationName` instead of `animation-name`), for the benefit of older Firefox

## 0.3.1

## 0.3.0

* If possible, and `options.useTimer` is not used, mogrify will use precomputed CSS keyframes to move the work off the main thread. This results in a vastly smoother experience on mobile (and desktop in some cases), at the cost of a slight loss in visual fidelity (which is barely noticeable for animations less than ~500ms)

* Rewrote as ES6 modules
* Started maintaining a changelog
